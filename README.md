# kmeans clustering using haskell

It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each sample belongs only to one group (cluster) that has similar properties.

It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.
